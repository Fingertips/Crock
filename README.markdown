# Crock

A really tiny piece of code to serialize Ruby hashes to JSON.

  require 'crock'
  JSON.generate([
    12, 'CafÃ©',
    {'on' => true}
  ]) # => ""

## Limitations

For the output to be valid all strings should be encoded in UTF-8 and only characters from the Basic Multilingual Plane are supported. Currently no special notations for floats are supported so serializing them might result in invalid JSON.
